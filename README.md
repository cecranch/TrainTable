# TrainTable

I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data using user-entered data. The timetable provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes away they are from the station. The site incorporatoes JavaScript, jQuery, and moment.js.
